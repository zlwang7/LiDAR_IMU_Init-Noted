# LiDAR_IMU_Init-Noted

 LiDAR_IMU_Init-Noted is the noted version of [LiDAR_IMU_Init](https://github.com/hku-mars/LiDAR_IMU_Init) (Zhu, Fangcheng, Yunfan Ren, and Fu Zhang. "Robust real-time lidar-inertial initialization."). 

If you want to better understand this code, I strongly recommend reading [FAST_LIO](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO) or [S-FAST_LIO](https://github.com/zlwang7/S-FAST_LIO).

In addition, the following links are also my previous works. They are the interpretation and detailed equation derivation of the FAST-LIO paper:
